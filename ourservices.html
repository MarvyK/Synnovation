                        We use creativity to supercharge critical and analytical thinking to uncover fresh solutions and implement new ideas. It's the kind of thinking that makes people more energised, positive, adaptive and resilient for change. The power of the approach is
                        that it simultaneously addresses creativity, novel strategies, behavioural and people issues, and focussed innovation to deliver practical implementation.

                                    Strategy decisions are more likely to deliver results if they are based on insight, both into the culture and innovation capabilities of your organisation as well as the needs of your customers. Working with the SynNovation catalysts, teams are able to identify and solve for gaps in your innovation systems, develop behaviours that support those systems and work with your customers to create fresh ideas that speak directly to their needs.

                                            Designed to equip people with deeper knowledge of the climate of innovation and introduction to several creative thinking tools for problem solving and innovation that combine into a full innovation process.  The knowledge is then embedded by a team immediately working on a task to find and novel solution to the point of and action plan to implement it.

                                            Similar to the Toolkit for Ideas, with the added value of discovering experientially, with video footage, the behaviours that promote creativity and success in teams – and what could get in the way. The introduction and combination of simple tools for creativity adds to the skill set and can be combined for more powerful results into an innovation process.
