                                    It's the kind of thinking that makes people more energised, positive, adaptive and resilient for change. The power of the approach is that it simultaneously addresses creativity, novel strategies, behavioural and people issues, and focussed innovation to deliver practical implementation.

                                    We work with a team whose diverse skills and backgrounds enable us to work locally, internationally, in-person or on-line and across multiple industries.

We have used it in South Africa since 1995, adapting and enriching it for use in the 21st century African context, and internationally.

She has worked in businesses of various sizes, government departments, in education and in communities and continues to play an active role in transformation in SA.<br /><br />

                                        Lu-Marié is an independent consultant and trainer in management systems and innovation since 1995. She is attracted to how innovative thinking can supercharge the concept of continuous improvement and how the SynNovation approach has proven to be much deeper than that; it subtly changes what people do, and how they behave and work together.<br /><br />
                                        With a BSc Food science, she started her career in Nampak’s Research laboratories, the biggest packaging company in the southern hemisphere and has worked actively in the South African food industry until relocating to Australia. In addition to her analytical scientific streak she has a strong creative side. Her versatility and wide interests, resulted in a wide range of clients including universities, the food industry, pharma, retail, the mining industry and actuaries. She is a sought-after trainer, who was head hunted to deliver training for Duke Corporate Education, consistently ranked top management training for over 2 decades. To better understand creative thinking, she completed an international Diploma in Neuroleadership (cum Laude) at University Stellenbosch Business School.<br /><br />
                                        Lu-Marié is passionate about sharing her knowledge and regularly presents at conferences and contributes to published articles and books.
