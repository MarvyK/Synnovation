                                It's the kind of thinking that makes people more energised, positive, adaptive and resilient for change. The power of the approach is that it simultaneously addresses creativity, novel strategies, behavioural and people issues, and focussed innovation to deliver practical implementation.

                                    Truida has had the benefit of playing and working with SynNovation since 1995 – yet she still regularly gains new insights on different ways in which we can use and strengthen the approach – often from participants. She loves sharing SynNovation with people of all ages, professions and backgrounds – and seeing how it unlocks productive fun, energy and excitement for them and for our team. She has worked in businesses of various sizes, government departments, in education and in communities and continues to play an active role in transformation in SA.<br /><br />
                                    Truida was at UNISA Graduate School of Business Leadership for 17 years, first as manager of marketing and public relations, then lecturing in management for ten years.  An independent consultant since 1988, she has published widely and guest-lectured at several universities.  Truida holds a BA from Stellenbosch University and a Master of Business Leadership from UNISA.

                                    Lu-Marié has been an independent consultant and trainer in management systems and innovation since 1995. She is attracted to how innovative thinking can supercharge the concept of continuous improvement and how the SynNovation approach has proven to be much deeper than that; it subtly changes what people do, and how they behave and work together.<br /><br />
                                    With a BSc Food Science, she started her career in the research laboratories of Nampak, the biggest packaging company in the southern hemisphere, and worked actively in the South African food industry until she relocated to Australia. In addition to her analytical scientific streak, she has a strong creative side. Her versatility and wide interests have resulted in a wide range of clients including universities, the food industry, pharma, retail, the mining industry and actuaries. She is a sought-after trainer, who was head-hunted to deliver training for Duke Corporate Education, consistently ranked top in management training for over 2 decades. To better understand creative thinking, she completed an international Diploma in Neuroleadership (Cum Laude) at University of Stellenbosch Business School.<br /><br />
                                    Lu-Marié is passionate about sharing her knowledge and regularly presents at conferences and contributes to published articles and books.

While working on a PhD on this topic, he is also working with the team to expand the impact of SynNovation, to enhance performance in business, in government and in communities.<br /><br />
